  Sometimes when we want to read some books on a specific topic or field, we confuse which book is good, and it will end with not read a book at all. Here, I develop a recommender system that suggests you a book to read based on the synopsis or description you want. This recommendation system uses the BERT algorithm to create word embedding and train and test the model to find the book that matches user preference entered by the synopsis or description.</description>

  When you search for something on Twitter or maybe want to see the trending topic, it usually appears a tweet that is not related to the hashtag or topic you search for. In the end, we don&amp;rsquo;t see the real tweet that has the same context as we search for. So, here we tried to make a classifier system that can distinguish the tweet spam or ham.</description>

  Today object detection is the hottest project in computer vision fields. Object detection is a computer vision technique that allows us to identify and locate objects in an image or video. But in this project, I tried another method to perform object detection. I used one of the Artificial Intelligence method, ANFIS. ANFIS stands for Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System. Combining the neural network and fuzzy logic can give advantages in making predictions more accurate based on the learning&amp;rsquo;s historical data.</description>

  Website phishing is one of the threats that may occur when we surf the internet. This website phishing can collect our private data like telephone number, bank account, credit card information, and other credentials data. Here I tried to develop a detection system that can detect any suspicious website that may try to do phishing. The idea is I collect the website URL that labelled as phishing and a legitimate website URL.</description>

      <description>Skills: Python, Deep Learning, Numpy, OpenCV, Yolo, PyQt5
The model in this case I used from Yolo model. The Yolo model can detect multiple objects in the photo, and video perfectly. But, in this case, I only used the model to detect the person label. So to increase the accuracy on predict the person label, I add more person labeled data to the model, and retrain the Yolo model. After got the optimum accuracy with more than 1000 iterations, I build the desktop application for real-time detection with the new Yolo model as the backend.</description>

      <description>Skills: Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, OpenCV, Keras, PyQt5
I used an open-source dataset Face Emotion Recognition to build the model first with Convolutional Neural Network algorithm. After got the optimum model that can accurately detect the emotion in the dataset, I bring the model into the real-time recognition with OpenCV library. After run successfully on real-time case, then I build the desktop application with PyQt5 library as the backend.</description>

      <description>Skills: Python, Machine Learning, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Librosa, PyQt5
In this case I used GTZAN music database as the dataset to build Machine Learning model. I extract the features like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) from the music with Librosa library, and from this information the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm can classified the music genres such as Pop, Jazz, Reggae, Rock, etc. In this case I also develop the desktop application, so the user can easily input the track and do the prediction.</description>
